User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

Your Task
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. 
Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that 
provides basic setup and usage instructions. You will use localStorage to store any persistent data.
